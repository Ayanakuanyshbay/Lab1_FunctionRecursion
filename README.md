# Lab1_FunctionRecursion

This project includes solutions to 10 function and recursion-based problems using Java.  
Each problem is implemented in a separate class, and all of them are tested in the unified `Main.java` file.

## ✅ Problems Covered

| #  | Problem Description                                 | Uses Recursion? |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1  | Find minimum element in an array                    | ❌              |
| 2  | Calculate average of array elements                 | ❌              |
| 3  | Check if a number is prime                          | ✅              |
| 4  | Calculate factorial of a number                     | ✅              |
| 5  | Find nth Fibonacci number                           | ✅              |
| 6  | Calculate a^n                                       | ✅              |
| 7  | Reverse array without using array structure         | ✅              |
| 8  | Check if a string contains only digits              | ✅              |
| 9  | Calculate binomial coefficient C(n, k)              | ✅              |
| 10 | Calculate GCD of two numbers using Euclidean method | ✅              |

## 📂 Project Structure


## 💡 How to Run

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Right-click `Main.java` → `Run Main.main()`
3. It will execute all 10 problems one by one with example inputs.

## 📈 Time Complexity

Each file contains comments explaining the time complexity of the algorithm used, such as:
```java
// Time Complexity: O(n)
